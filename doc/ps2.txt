# The PS/2 subsystem

This subsystem translates keycodes received by a PS/2 keyboard
and provides a (key?) word. To work, drivers need to provide
this:

(ps2kc)   -- kc    Returns the next typed PS/2 keycode from the
                   console. 0 if nothing was typed.

Then, it's as simple as loading PS2SUB to your xcomp.
