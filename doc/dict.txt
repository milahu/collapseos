# Dictionary

List of words defined in arch-specific boot code and core words.

# Glossary

Stack notation: "<stack before> -- <stack after>". Rightmost is
top of stack (TOS). For example, in "a b -- c d", b is TOS
before, d is TOS after. "R:" means that the Return Stack is
modified.

Some words have a variable stack signature, most often in pair
with a flag. These are indicated with "?" to tell that the argu-
ment might not be there. For example, "-- n? f" means that "n"
might or might not be there.

Some words consume contents from input and this is indicated by
"x", "y" and "..." elements next to the word itself, not in the
stack signature. For example, ": x ... ;" means that the word
":" will consume an element "x" (which is usually explained in
the description), followed by an arbitrary length of contents,
which is ended by ";".

Word references (wordref): When we say we have a "word
reference", it's a pointer to a word's entry point. That is,
making native jump to the address contained in the wordref will
execute the word.

For example, the address that "' DUP" puts on the stack is a
word reference to DUP. See doc/impl for details.

"*I*" in description indicates an IMMEDIATE word.
"*A*" in description indicates A register usage.

# Symbols

Across words, different symbols are used in different contexts,
but we try to be consistent in their use. Here's their defini-
tions:

! - Store
@ - Fetch
$ - Initialize
^ - Arguments in their opposite order
< - Input
> - 1. Pointer in a buffer 2. Opposite of "<".
( - Lower boundary
) - Upper boundary
' - Address of
* - Word indirection (pointer to word)
? - "Is it ...?" or "do ... if flag"
[...] - Indicates immediateness

Placement of those symbols is often important. In I/O-related
words for example, symbold to the left of the words refer to
input and to the right, output. For "?", placement at the right
refer to the first form, placement at the left refer to the
second form.

# System variables

See doc/usage for details. These ones have a "'" pair:

BLK>     Currently selected Block.
CURRENT  Address of the last word of the dictionary.
HERE     Addr of next available space in dict
IN(      Beginning of the input buffer.
IN>      Current pos in input buffer.

These ones are addresses and must be accessed with @ and !:

IOERR    Nonzero when an IO error occurred in some drivers.
NL       1 or 2 chars to spit during NL>, MSB first. If MSB is
         0, it's ignored.
LN<      Routine that feeds lines to the interpreter. Generally
         RDLN.
BLKDTY   Whether current block is dirty

# Values and aliases

TO x     n --         Write n to value x.
[TO] x   n --         *I*. Same as TO.
VAL!     n a --       Write n to value a.

# Entry management

'? x      -- f Find x it in dict. If found, f=1. Otherwise, f=0.
' x       -- w Push addr of word x to w. If not found, aborts.
['] x     --   *I* Like "'", but spits the addr as a number
               literal. If not found, aborts.
FIND      sa sl -- w? f
          Find "sa sl" in dict. If found, w=wordref, f=1.
          Otherwise, f=0.
FORGET x  --   Rewind the dictionary (both CURRENT and HERE) up
               to x's previous entry.

# Defining words

: x ... ;   --     Define a new word.
:~ ... ;    --     Define a new anonymous word.
~           --     *I* Compile a reference to the last defined
                   anonymous word.
ALIAS x y   --     Define an alias y with a starting value of x
CREATE x    --     Create cell named x. Doesn't allocate.
CODE x      --     Define a new native word.
CODE~       --     Define a new anonymous native word.
[COMPILE] x --     *I* Compile word x and write it to HERE.
                   IMMEDIATE words are *not* executed.
COMPILE x   --     *I* Meta compiles: write wordrefs that will
                   compile x when executed.
CONSTANT x  n --   Create a constant x with value n.
CONSTS ...  n --   Creates n new constants. See usage.txt.
VALUE x     n --   Creates cell x that when called pushes its
                   value.
VALUES ...  n --   Create a serie of n values. See usage.txt
DOER        --     See primer.txt

IMMEDIATE   --     Flag the latest defined word as immediate.
LITN        n --   Write number n as a literal.

# Flow

Note that flow words can only be used in definitions. In the
INTERPRET loop, they don't have the desired effect because each
word from the input stream is executed immediately. In this
context, branching doesn't work.

f IF A ELSE B THEN: if f is true, execute A, if false, execute
B. ELSE is optional.
[IF] .. [THEN]: Meta-IF. Works outside definitions. No [ELSE].
BEGIN .. f UNTIL: if f is false, branch to BEGIN.
BEGIN .. AGAIN: Always branch to BEGIN.
n >R BEGIN .. NEXT: Loop n times.

(           --   *I* Comment. Ignore input until ")" is read.
\           --   *I* Line comment. Ignore input until EOL.
[           --   *I* Begin interpretative mode. In a definition,
                 execute words instead of compiling them.
]           --   End interpretative mode.
ABORT       --   Resets PS and RS and returns to interpreter.
ABORT" ..." --   *I* Compiles a ." followed by a ABORT.
EXECUTE     a -- Execute wordref at addr a
INTERPRET   --   Main interpret loop.
LEAVE       --   In a DO..LOOP, exit at the next LOOP call.
QUIT        --   Reset RS, return to interpreter prompt.

          Returns whether string s1 == s2.

# I/O

.        n --     Print n in its decimal form
.x       n --     Print n's LSB in hex form. Always 2
                  characters.
.X       n --
         Print n in hex form. Always 4 characters.
         Numbers are never considered negative. "-1 .X" --> ffff
," ..." --        Write ... to HERE
." ..." --        *I* Compiles string literal ... followed by a
                  call to STYPE.
CURWORD -- sa sl  Yield the last read word (see WORD).
EMIT    c --      Spit char c to output stream
EMITLN  a --      *A* EMIT line at addr a
IN<     -- c      Read one char from buffered input, if end of
                  input is reached, read new line.

IN(     -- a      Beginning of input buffer.
IN)     -- a      End of the input buffer, exclusive.
IN$     --        Flush input buffer
KEY?    -- c? f   Polls the keyboard for a key. If a key is
                  pressed, f is true and c is the char. Other-
                  wise, f is false and c is *not* on the stack.

NL>     --        Emit newline
PARSE   sa sl -- n? f *A*

PC@     a -- c    Fetch c from port a
SPC>    --        Emit space character
STYPE   sa sl --  *A* EMIT all chars of string.
WAITW   sa sl --  Call WORD until we get the same string as
                  sa sl.
WORD    -- sa sl  Read one word from buffered input and push it.
                  That word is a string (begins with a length
                  byte).
WORD!   sa sl --  The next WORD call will not read from input
                  and yield this string instead.

These ASCII consts are defined:
EOT BS CR LF SPC

KEY? and EMIT are aliases to (key?) and (emit) (see doc/drivers)
KEY is a loop over KEY?.

NL> spits CRLF by default, but can be configured to spit an
alternate newline char. See impl.txt.

                 inclusive.
WIPE   --        *A* Empties current block

Note: Most BLK words don't actually use the A register them-
selves, but we want to allow BLK drivers to make usage of it,
so you *should* guard yourself again A changes when using those.

# RX/TX subsystem (see doc/rxtx)

RX<?   -- c? f   If a char is available on RX, return it in c
                 with f=1. Otherwise, f=0.
RX<    -- c      Block until a char is available in RX.
RX<<   --        Consume RX<? and drop result until there's
                 nothing to be received.
RX[    --        Replace KEY? with RX<?.
]RX    --        Put back the old KEY? handler.
TX>    c --      Spit c to TX, blocking until it can do it.
TX[    --        Replace EMIT with TX>.

# Other

BOOT    --       Boot back to a fresh system.

NOOP    --       Do nothing.
TICKS   n --     Wait for approximately n*100 microseconds.
                 Don't use with n=0.

# Loaders

These words load the related application from blocks:

ARCHM  Arch-specific loader words and macros
ED     Block Editor
VE     Visual Editor
ME     Memory Editor
RSH    Remote shell and XMODEM implementation
AVRP   AVR programmer
XCOMP  Cross-compilation tools

# Kernel internals

Some words from the kernel are designed to be internal but
ended up being used in "userland". Let's document them:

_bchk   n -- n     Checks whether n is a valid 8-bit signed
                   branching offset, that is, in the range -128
                   to 127. If not, abort with "br ovfl".
