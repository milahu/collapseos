This changelog aims to be from a high-level perspective. For more details,
see relevant RCS logs.

*** 2021-02-11

- Add 6809 port WIP! Well, more of a placeholder... or a sneeze, really.
  But it's a first step, and it actually runs on actual hardware and was
  developed and deployed from Collapse OS itself.
- Rename HERE to H and H@ to HERE. I had it all wrong...
- Make QUIT and ABORT into native words.
- Remove ROLL which wasn't used anywhere.
- Add |T T! and T, words to assemblers. See "Endian-ness" in doc/cross.txt.
- Add "QUIT jump" to stable ABI.
- Fix endian-ness bugs in 6809 assembler
- Add "LIVETGT" helper to assemblers. See "Live Targets" in doc/asm/intro.txt.
- Improve Remote Shell reliability. It's now reliable enough for "rupload" to
  be used for real stuff (for example, writing 6809 binaries to EEPROM!)
- tools: make blkunpack right-trim whitespaces.
- trs80-4p can now use both floppy drives.
- trs80-4p add WIP "native" keyboard driver in effort to remove dependency on
  TRS-DOS.
- Place Z80 drivers together in their own little zone in blkfs.
- Make font compilers more compact and fix a few glitches.
