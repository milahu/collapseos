This changelog aims to be from a high-level perspective. For more details,
see relevant RCS logs.

*** 2021-02-19

- Make good progress on 6809 port!
- Add W"" literal, allowing to "compile" WORD-using words. For example,
  ": foo W" hello" CREATE ;" becomes possible.
- Remove "~C!" mechanism. It was unnecessary and slow. Made the AT28 driver,
  the reason for this system, use simple C! and ! overrides.
- Remove 0, 1 and -1 native words and replace them with (b). It makes porting
  simpler and makes binaries slightly slimmer overall.
- Make S0 into a Forth word.
- Add []= and make S= into a Forth word.
- Remove CMP and make =, < and > native.
- Improve 6809 assembler.
- Make xcomp tools endian-aware.
- Replace native _find with FIND. We don't need to find words in alternate dicts
  anymore now that we have XFIND.
- DOES>: swap PFA and jump address so that more than 2b can be attached it.
  As a bonus, fix DOES> on 8086. It was simply broken.
- Improve documentation, especially impl.txt which had a lot of out-of-date
  and incomplete information.

*** 2021-02-11

- Add 6809 port WIP! Well, more of a placeholder... or a sneeze, really.
  But it's a first step, and it actually runs on actual hardware and was
  developed and deployed from Collapse OS itself.
- Rename HERE to H and H@ to HERE. I had it all wrong...
- Make QUIT and ABORT into native words.
- Remove ROLL which wasn't used anywhere.
- Add |T T! and T, words to assemblers. See "Endian-ness" in doc/cross.txt.
- Add "QUIT jump" to stable ABI.
- Fix endian-ness bugs in 6809 assembler
- Add "LIVETGT" helper to assemblers. See "Live Targets" in doc/asm/intro.txt.
- Improve Remote Shell reliability. It's now reliable enough for "rupload" to
  be used for real stuff (for example, writing 6809 binaries to EEPROM!)
- tools: make blkunpack right-trim whitespaces.
- trs80-4p can now use both floppy drives.
- trs80-4p add WIP "native" keyboard driver in effort to remove dependency on
  TRS-DOS.
- trs80-4p: improve RS-232 driver.
- Place Z80 drivers together in their own little zone in blkfs.
- Make font compilers more compact and fix a few glitches.

*** 2021-01-25

- Make Z80 and 8086 assemblers more compact
- Add 6809 assembler
- Create a new "asm" folder in doc, making it clearer.
- Add KEY> core word
- Fix PS leak in DUMP
- Improve VE

*** 2021-01-19

- Remove "breathing" in tools/. Now that we have proper RTS/CTS in place,
  this mechanism is spurious.
- Improve VE.
- Remove C<? word.
- Improve LOAD.
- Remove CURRENT*.
- Improve Remote Shell and add "rupload".
- Allow using aliases in xcomp.
- Improve ACIA drivers in trs80 and rc2014.
- Add "constant" word type, making CONSTANT much faster and usable in cross-
  compilation.
- Make Block Editor and Visual Editor a bit more compact in blkfs.

*** 2021-01-05

- Initial RCS-based release
- Remove all git-related files
- Transform .md files into plain text
- Add "make clean" command in every Makefile
- Add top-level "make clean" and "make dist"
