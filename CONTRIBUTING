# Contribute to Collapse OS

Thanks for considering participating to Collapse OS. That the
idea of a post-collapse operating system sparks your interest is
great.

However, this is a very personal and opinionated project and
this doesn't fit well with the idea of collective development.
The code is so tightly integrated, holistic, that you are
unlikely to find areas of improvements that I would agree with.
Changing a part is changing the whole.

Discussions? certainly! Come over the mailing list and let's
discuss design choices, implementation details, whatever. I'm
not perfect and make plenty of mistakes, some of which you can
certainly spot.

The general "Github" way to contribute to a project is to take
a look around the code, find some bug or area of improvement and
then submit it as the proposal. The code is the discussion.

With Collapse OS having a radical approach to simplicity,
implementation is often trivial. What is difficult is the
*choice*. That choice needs context, discussion. So, let's start
with this instead of the diff.

I know what you're thinking. This isn't fun. You like the idea
of Collapse OS and you want to hack into the code. I completely
understand it and I am flattered that the project inspires this
in you.

Why not fork? Pour your own creative energy into the idea, make
your own personal take. I don't hold absolute truths, my
designs might be bad. Then, let's show each other the result
and steal good ideas from each other.

Sure, it's me who owns the collapseos.org domain, but that's my
first mover privilege :)
